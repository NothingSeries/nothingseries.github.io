# Nothing Series Performance Mods Wiki

[WEBSITE](https://nothingseries.github.io/)

Welcome to the Nothing Series Performance Mods Wiki! This documentation provides comprehensive information about Minecraft performance mods across different mod loaders and versions.

it is made to be a replacement for the current kinda out of date github wikis which just don't look rly good or have old information.

## About

This wiki is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and contains information about performance mods for:
- NeoForge
- Forge
- Fabric
- Quilt

## Local Development

```zsh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy-gh
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Setting up CurseForge Proxy

1. Copy `curseforge-proxy.js.template` to `curseforge-proxy.js`
2. Set your CurseForge API key in your environment variables
3. The proxy will automatically use the API key from the environment variable
NEVER commit your actual API key to the repository. The `curseforge-proxy.js` file is gitignored.
